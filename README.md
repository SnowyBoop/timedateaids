A list of the timdatectl timezones that people ACTUALLY use and a script to just set the goddamn time, cuz aparently everyone lives in africa that uses arch, so lets bloat this stuff with useless timezones.

All of the antartica africa china zones are debloated kekw.

Ill probably merge this into the arch config repo later
